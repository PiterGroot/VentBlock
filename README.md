# Vent block mod
<br>_Requires HalbLibe => 3.5.4_

#### A small minecraft BTA mod that adds a vent block for mob/item transportation.

Specifically made for Minecraft Better Than Adventure 7.1_01.

This new block can be used for lots of different contraptions and builds. The vent block propels entities upwards for a total of 8 blocks.

Sneak while walking above a vent block will result in you falling down again and ignoring fall damage!

_**Multiplayer is not supported**, I might add support in the future._
